		<h3>The Admissions Process at Lighthouse School</h3>
		<h5>Thank you for your interest in Nantucket Lighthouse School!</h5>
		<p>
			If you are interested in learning more about our program for your preschool – 8th grader, I encourage you to join us for an Open House or to call me to set up a tour.  Nothing conveys our rich educational offering better than a visit to the school when it is in session.
		</p> 
		<h5>Here’s how the admissions process works:</h5>
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				Attend an <a href="#">Open House</a> or set up a tour and request a packet of information about the school.
			</li>
			<li>
				Submit a completed application. <a href="#">(Download application PDF.)</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Interview for admissions. The interview is typically 45 minutes in length and gives you a chance to ask any questions you may have after having attended an Open House or taken a tour, and it gives our Head of School an opportunity to meet your child and determine where he or she would best fit in our school.
			</li>
			<li>
				After the interview is concluded, and if you are interested, your child is invited to visit the school for a full or half day.
			</li>			
			<li>
				Admissions notification is mailed out with a commitment contract.
			</li>	

		</ol>

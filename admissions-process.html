			<h5>Thank you for your interest in Nantucket Lighthouse School!</h5>
			<p>
				If you are interested in learning more about our program for your preschool – 8th grader, I encourage you to join us for an Open House or to call me to set up a tour.  Nothing conveys our rich educational offering better than a visit to the school when it is in session.
			</p> 
			<h3>Here’s how the admissions process works:</h3>
			
			<ol>
				<li>
					Attend an <a href="#">Open House</a> or set up a tour and request a packet of information about the school.
				</li>
				<li>
					Submit a completed application. <a href="#">(Download application PDF.)</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					Interview for admissions. The interview is typically 45 minutes in length and gives you a chance to ask any questions you may have after having attended an Open House or taken a tour, and it gives our Head of School an opportunity to meet your child and determine where he or she would best fit in our school.
				</li>
				<li>
					After the interview is concluded, and if you are interested, your child is invited to visit the school for a full or half day.
				</li>			
				<li>
					Admissions notification is mailed out with a commitment contract.
				</li>	

			</ol>

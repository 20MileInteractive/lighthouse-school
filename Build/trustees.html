She continues to support AFS, believing strongly in the study abroad experience. She has tutored adult English language learners through the Literacy Project at the Nantucket Atheneum, served two terms on the Nantucket School Committee, and has served on the Town Association, an affiliate of the Civic League, for the past eight years, where she just began her second year as president of the organization.

						D. Anne has been a community organizer for many years, both as a volunteer and a professional. Her commitment to children and education was evident in her work in her former community of Summit, New Jersey, which is also where she grew up. D. Anne was instrumental in planning, building and raising funds for a new, state-of-the-art, day-care facility in the mid-70s which was the center for a system of quality child-care services for families in Summit and surrounding communities. At the time, the Summit Child Care Center was a model for such comprehensive programs on the state, regional and national levels. She also served two terms on the Summit Board of Education, enabling her to give back to the school system that educated her. When the Atherton family moved to Nantucket to live year-round twenty years ago, D. Anne became involved in the Nantucket Public School System, advocating for increased parent involvement and advancing the organizational capacity of Friends of Nantucket Public Schools, our island's PTA. She also served on the founding steering committee of the Nantucket Education Trust and was a catalyst for the school-staff housing building project. In the mid-90s, D. Anne and Kim Horyn formed Atherton Horyn Associates (AHA), a consulting firm that provided services to Nantucket non-profits and businesses for several years, ranging from organizational development to community relations to fundraising to strategic planning. The first project for AHA was to work with a group of skating enthusiasts to make Nantucket Ice, their rink of dreams, a reality. AHA's subsequent clients represented the diversity of the community and included the Chamber of Commerce, Star of the Sea Youth Hostel, the Town of Nantucket, the MSPCA and the UMASS Boston Nantucket Field Station, to name a few. D. Anne and her husband, Rick, were recent Co-Presidents of the Nantucket Civic League, focusing on neighborhood and community issues, and D. Anne is presently a member of the Town's Roads and Right of Way Committee. On a personal note, one year ago, the Athertons became proud grandparents of a Nantucket native, making D. Anne's commitment to our island's children, their education and their future even stronger.

						Suzanne came to live on Nantucket 30 years ago and worked in the service industry while raising her two sons, River and Zeb, with her husband, carpenter Andrew Bennett. Currently, she can be found sharing her interest in literature with Bookworks customers. Suzanne joined as a member of the founding NLS Board when Zeb, who attended Lizbet's Small School, joined the very first Lighthouse School class and ultimately became one of the school's first graduates. After a brief leave, Suzanne rejoined the Board because she believes in what Lighthouse is all about.  "As e.e. cummings once said, 'To be nobody but yourself in a world that's doing its best to make you somebody else, is to fight the hardest battle you are ever going to fight.' Lighthouse School is the perfect school to help you to be who you are. That is why I believe it is of value."

						Caleb grew up on Nantucket and returned to the island after high school and college years spent at off island schools. He is a musician and can be found playing his fiddle at various venues and with a number of local bands, including island favorites, Coq Au Vin and Four Easy Payments. Caleb and his wife Lindsey, creator of Spoon Home Textiles, live on an old farm near the cranberry bogs where they continue the tradition of the property by gardening and raising chickens, sheep and other critters. He has traveled many times to India, Israel, Europe, and Australia. Caleb learned about Lighthouse through friends who have children at the school and thinks that it is a marvelous place to grow and learn. "It uses a non-institutional and individualized curriculum that recognizes personal responsibility and develops conceptual understanding of all subjects before memorization and repetitive tasks are employed to practice and hone academic skills. This way of learning allows for a deeper knowledge of, and interest in, all subjects."

						Sabrina came to Nantucket through her love of art and her grandmother who lived here.  She nurtured her love of art through NISDA and fell in love with Nantucket in the process.  Since living on the island, Sabrina has worked mainly with children, as a nanny and at Small Friends.  As an advisor on a family Foundation, she has contributed to many worthy island projects in the arts and education. Sabrina's son Ben graduated from the Lighthouse Middle School in 2012.  Her devotion to Lighthouse School comes from her son's transformative experience and her genuine appreciation of the school's integrated curriculum that focuses on both arts and academics.

						Lizbet co-founded Lighthouse School with Elizabeth Sundell in 1999 and has served as the Director of Education. She has worked with young children for over 25 years in pre-school and elementary school classrooms. She moved to Nantucket in 1991 to teach at NES before leaving and creating her own pre-school program, which evolved into the current Lighthouse Small School. Lizbet's philosophy of education is inspired and informed by the work of Rudolf Steiner (founder of Waldorf Education), the Integrated Day approach of the Antioch New England Graduate School, the social curriculum and philosophy of the Mead School, and her practical experience in the classroom. Lizbet currently serves as an educational advisor to Lighthouse faculty. She is married to Waterman Chris Fuller and son Eli happily attends Lighthouse School. "We set out to create a school that honors the magic of childhood while creatively introducing children to the ideas, information, and tools they will need to construct meaningful and rewarding lives. In turn, the school has generated a wonderful and caring community of teachers, staff members, families, and friends."

						An island native, Kate grew up in and around Boston before earning her B.A in English and Art History at Lafayette College. She studied Interior Design at Parsons School of Design and Rhode Island School of Design and then returned to Nantucket to build upon these studies. Solo travel to Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand provided a timely shift to a new field of work. Kate felt right at home when first walking down the halls of Lighthouse School and shortly thereafter joined Erin Dancik's Primary class as a teaching assistant. She undertook her own Small School Class the following year and has moved up with her first students to teach Kinderclass, Lower Primary and Middle Primary. In 2010, Kate received her M.Ed. from Fitchburg State College. Five years ago, Kate founded her own small Summer Camp, which is in full swing in July and August. In her spare time, she enjoys oil painting, strolling through the woods with her dog and practicing yoga.

A certified Kundalini Yoga teacher, Joan has taught yoga classes, including pre-natal and yoga therapy, on island for nearly 20 years. She is married to Jacques Zimicki. Their son Zephyr attended Lighthouse for six years and their daughter Aurora, who started out in the Kinderclass, is now in the Lighthouse Middle School. "When researching school options, I was impressed that the curriculum is based on the developmental needs of young children. Quiet, focused activities are alternated with more active ones. Field trips and outside exploration are an integral part of the day. It was the perfect choice for our very active son and a great fit for our daughter as well. As a parent I have seen how the Lighthouse School's integrated approach to learning has served my children. I cannot imagine a more worthwhile endeavor than to assist the school in giving the best possible education to Nantucket's children." Joan serves on the Finance Committee and also sits on the Executive Committee.

						Born in Southern California, Jon moved to the east coast when he was in grade school. He graduated from Landmark School on the North Shore of Boston and then UMASS Amherst. In 1989, he moved to Nantucket where his family had summered for many years. Jon started his landscaping business and met his wife Lisa on the island. Jon and Lisa have four children, all of whom attend Nantucket Lighthouse School. Jon was first attracted to Lighthouse School because the school's approach to children closely mirrored that of his own educational experience at Landmark. Jon enjoys spending his free time with his children, biking, skiing, fishing, and playing hockey.

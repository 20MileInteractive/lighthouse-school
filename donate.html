		<h3>Support The Lighthouse School</h3>
		<h4>Donate Online</h4>
		<p>
			The Nantucket Lighthouse School depends on the generosity of our parents, faculty, friends, alumni, businesses and foundations to help create a supportive environment that nurtures the development and education of our students. With this support, our students build the foundation they need to contribute to their community and the world.  Thanks to the strong ties we have with our community of supporters, Lighthouse School is also able to in turn offer our island community programming such as the annual Yuletide Fair, Storytelling Festival, and Educational Workshops for parents and teachers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Independent schools rely on extra support above and beyond tuition. The cost of educating our children, of giving them a solid foundation, requires generous tax-deductible gifts.  Help us to continue offering our vibrant program to as many students as possible, and to maintain and grow our community programming.
		</p>
		<p>
			Below are examples of just some of the ways in which you can help:
		</p>
		
		<h4>Annual Giving</h4>
		<p>
			Annual Fund dollars support the school's operating budget, which is comprised of expenses such as teacher salaries, professional development, financial aid, and student programs. A healthy Annual Fund allows our Trustees to set tuition at a level that encourages financial diversity. Annual Fund gifts make a significant difference in the lives of our students and enable us to fulfill our mission.
		</p>

		<h4>Event Sponsorship</h4>
		<p>
			Nantucket Lighthouse School’s annual Garden Festival and Yuletide Fair are highly anticipated events that attract a diverse attendee based of both residents and visitors alike.  These events are created to both enrich our island community and to help support the Lighthouse School’s annual budget.  Becoming a sponsor of one or both of these events allows you to contribute in a meaningful way to the sustainability of the Lighthouse School.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are a business seeking increased visibility in front of the island’s many residents and visitors, Event Sponsorship is a fantastic way to further your brand.  The benefits of sponsorship vary.  To learn more, please contact Director of Development Joy Margolis at 508-228-0427 or by email at jmargolis@nantucketlighthouseschool.org

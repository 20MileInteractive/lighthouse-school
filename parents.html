			Nantucket Lighthouse School is a vibrant community of parents, faculty, staff and students.  Lighthouse School parents’ involvement in their child’s education enhances the school experience and enriches the community. We ask for and rely upon the participation of parents in the day to day life of the school.

			There are several ways that parents are invited to participate, including:
			<li>PALS – The Parent Association of Nantucket Lighthouse School</li>
			<li>Back To School Parent Discussion Evenings: a discussion that focuses on the philosophy, curriculum, development and education of young children, held in September.</li>
			<li>Yuletide Fair, December</li>
			<li>State of the School Meeting: a discussion of the administrative aspects of the school, January </li>
			<li><a href="#">Nantucket Garden Festival, July</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h4>The Parent Association of Nantucket Lighthouse School</h4>
		<p>
			The Parent Association of Nantucket Lighthouse School was established to facilitate and promote a meaningful partnership between home and school. The parents of all NLS students, both current and alumni, are considered to be PALS members. PALS works collaboratively with parents, faculty and staff to provide opportunities for parent engagement, encourage communication within the school and Nantucket community, advocate for the school, and support the school's staff members. PALS initiates faculty luncheons, NLS community events, parent educational programs, and mentoring opportunities. PALS reaches out to NLS families so that they feel welcomed and receive useful information from fellow parents. The PALS Interim Steering Committee comprised of past and current NLS parents- Sabrina Elwell, Lucy Hehir, Allison Herr, Denise Riseborough and Berta Scott. Contact PALS at palsnls@gmail.com.

			The approach to teaching each child as an individual, was one of the deciding factors in our choosing theLighthouse School. Just walking into the classrooms, I immediately “got it.” I knew this was not only a perfect fit for my child but also for my family.

			The school is an integral part of our family life. It has profoundly affected my parenting and how I run my own life. It is inspiring to see how children are treated with care and thoughtfulness, both asindividuals and as a group; they are taught to respect others. When we first enrolled, the LighthouseSchool only went to third grade and, while we were there, it grew through the eighth grade and so we hadour child at Lighthouse for eleven years.

			I cannot imagine what turns our lives would have taken if we had not had this incredible school availableto us. Having the Lighthouse School on our small island is a gift to the already wonderful lives we livehere. Our mission statement talks about “the creative act of learning.” Throughout our program, I am awareof how the school teaches a child to love to learn by inspiring and celebrating ‘self-expression’ throughjournaling and small class sizes that encourage thoughtful conversation and individualized learning. I amstruck by the ease in which children learn in an environment that is surrounded by the handwork work thatthey make and how children are called upon to assess themselves, which gives them the responsibility fortheir actions. I value the way in which a strong academic curriculum is intertwined with beauty, nature,thoughtfulness, and care for each child. It is a very tactile approach to learning.

			Education, in our current world environment, has lost sight of the child. We teach to a test, for someunclear end. The Nantucket Lighthouse School celebrates childhood, and teaches children a love oflearning, and a respect for each individual.

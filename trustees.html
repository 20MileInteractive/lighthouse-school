				<b>D. Anne Atherton </b><br />
			</p>
			<p>
				D. Anne has been a community organizer for many years, both as a volunteer and a professional. Her commitment to children and education was evident in her work in her former community of Summit, New Jersey, which is also where she grew up. D. Anne was instrumental in planning, building and raising funds for a new, state-of-the-art, day-care facility in the mid-70s which was the center for a system of quality child-care services for families in Summit and surrounding communities. At the time, the Summit Child Care Center was a model for such comprehensive programs on the state, regional and national levels. She also served two terms on the Summit Board of Education, enabling her to give back to the school system that educated her. When the Atherton family moved to Nantucket to live year-round twenty years ago, D. Anne became involved in the Nantucket Public School System, advocating for increased parent involvement and advancing the organizational capacity of Friends of Nantucket Public Schools, our island's PTA. She also served on the founding steering committee of the Nantucket Education Trust and was a catalyst for the school-staff housing building project. In the mid-90s, D. Anne and Kim Horyn formed Atherton Horyn Associates (AHA), a consulting firm that provided services to Nantucket non-profits and businesses for several years, ranging from organizational development to community relations to fundraising to strategic planning. The first project for AHA was to work with a group of skating enthusiasts to make Nantucket Ice, their rink of dreams, a reality. AHA's subsequent clients represented the diversity of the community and included the Chamber of Commerce, Star of the Sea Youth Hostel, the Town of Nantucket, the MSPCA and the UMASS Boston Nantucket Field Station, to name a few. D. Anne and her husband, Rick, were recent Co-Presidents of the Nantucket Civic League, focusing on neighborhood and community issues, and D. Anne is presently a member of the Town's Roads and Right of Way Committee. On a personal note, one year ago, the Athertons became proud grandparents of a Nantucket native, making D. Anne's commitment to our island's children, their education and their future even stronger.

				<b>Suzanne Bennett</b><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Suzanne came to live on Nantucket 30 years ago and worked in the service industry while raising her two sons, River and Zeb, with her husband, carpenter Andrew Bennett. Currently, she can be found sharing her interest in literature with Bookworks customers. Suzanne joined as a member of the founding NLS Board when Zeb, who attended Lizbet's Small School, joined the very first Lighthouse School class and ultimately became one of the school's first graduates. After a brief leave, Suzanne rejoined the Board because she believes in what Lighthouse is all about.  "As e.e. cummings once said, 'To be nobody but yourself in a world that's doing its best to make you somebody else, is to fight the hardest battle you are ever going to fight.' Lighthouse School is the perfect school to help you to be who you are. That is why I believe it is of value."

				<b>Caleb Cressman </b><br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Caleb grew up on Nantucket and returned to the island after high school and college years spent at off island schools. He is a musician and can be found playing his fiddle at various venues and with a number of local bands, including island favorites, Coq Au Vin and Four Easy Payments. Caleb and his wife Lindsey, creator of Spoon Home Textiles, live on an old farm near the cranberry bogs where they continue the tradition of the property by gardening and raising chickens, sheep and other critters. He has traveled many times to India, Israel, Europe, and Australia. Caleb learned about Lighthouse through friends who have children at the school and thinks that it is a marvelous place to grow and learn. "It uses a non-institutional and individualized curriculum that recognizes personal responsibility and develops conceptual understanding of all subjects before memorization and repetitive tasks are employed to practice and hone academic skills. This way of learning allows for a deeper knowledge of, and interest in, all subjects."

Lizbet currently serves as an educational advisor to Lighthouse faculty. She is married to Waterman Chris Fuller and son Eli happily attends Lighthouse School. "We set out to create a school that honors the magic of childhood while creatively introducing children to the ideas, information, and tools they will need to construct meaningful and rewarding lives.

Field trips and outside exploration are an integral part of the day. It was the perfect choice for our very active son and a great fit for our daughter as well. As a parent I have seen how the Lighthouse School's integrated approach to learning has served my children. I cannot imagine a more worthwhile endeavor than to assist the school in giving the best possible education to Nantucket's children."

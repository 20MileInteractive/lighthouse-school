				The 5th <a href="#">Annual Nantucket Garden Festival (NGF)</a> will be held July 25th-July 27th, 2013 at <a herf="#">Pumpkin Pond Farm.</a> The Nantucket Garden Festival provides a fresh approach to gardening, inspiring all generations of gardeners while maintaining a pledge of conservation and sustainability. Nantucket has a myriad of extraordinary gardens and is a premiere destination for any traveling horticulturist. The NGF captures the romance and allure of gardening on Nantucket with an opening night bash, A Summer Tea with George Schoellkopf of Hollister House Garden and lecture with best-selling author Amy Stewart. In addition, there are unique children’s activities, community challenges and exclusive garden tours.
